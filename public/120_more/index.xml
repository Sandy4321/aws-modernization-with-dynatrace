      <description>OneAgent is responsible for collecting all monitoring data within your monitored environment. A single OneAgent per host is required to collect all relevant monitoring dataâ€”even if your hosts are deployed within Docker containers, microservices architectures, or cloud-based infrastructure.
The OneAgent can be automatically installed and rolled out through configuration management tools such as Chef, Puppet, Ansible, AWS extentions &amp;amp; AWS Resource Management (ARM) templates or by just including the download and install into any custom deployment script.</description>
