[AWS Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/) is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that lets you write, run, and debug your code with just a browser. It includes a code editor, debugger, and terminal. Cloud9 comes prepackaged with essential tools for popular programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, PHP, and more, so you donâ€™t need to install files or configure your development machine to start new projects.

### Add a new Cloud9 environment

1 . Navigate to the the cloud9 console page from [this link](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/home) or just search for it.
