# Welcome

Moving to modern containterized microservice architectures brings IT new challenges as these new applications are more complex and unpredictable than ever. System health problems are rarely well understood from the outset and IT teams spend a significant amount of time manually solving problems and putting out fires after the fact. 

The good news is that Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service ([Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/)) and Dynatrace platform are proven solutions to managing this problem.

* Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service ([Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/)) is a managed service that makes it easy for you to run Kubernetes on AWS without needing to stand up or maintain your own Kubernetes control plane. 

* [Dynatrace](https://www.dynatrace.com) is an [EKS certified partner](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/partners/) and provides detailed monitoring and dashboarding for real-time visibility into the performance and health of Kubernetes applications. Dynatrace OneAgent is container-aware and comes with built-in support for out-of-the-box monitoring of Amazon EKS down to the infrastructure layer including application-only monitoring.

## Workshop

This workshop provides with the step-by-step instructions to provision and operate an EKS cluster with Dynatrace to gain immediate observality to application transactions, nodes, pods, and namespaces for a microservice sample application.
