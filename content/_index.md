Cloud technology is now fundamental to any modern business strategy, and a low-risk, smooth transition is everyone’s greatest hope.

Join Dynatrace and AWS at this hands-on workshop and make it so!  We’ll show you how to use advanced observability as a strategy to give you actionable insights every step of the way, from assessing, planning, migrating, and finally optimization.

The workshop will start you from the eyes of an engineer at “Mythical Mysfits” corporation and a list of issues the team is facing. As a new member of the team, you’ll be hands-on tasked with provisioning AWS resources, installing Dynatrace monitoring for AWS, and building and understanding some full-stack metrics to help you guide the course.

## What will you learn?

* Automatically discover applications, services, processes, hosts and build a complete dependency map for the entire application environment
* Open up full end-user, application and infrastructure visibility for BOTH your classic, on-premises systems AND your modern cloud environments with a single solution
* Understand the swift process for significantly reduce troubleshooting by using AI to automatically detect problems and pinpoint the root cause and reveal business impact (with zero configuration processes)
* Detect if customers are impacted or disrupted by the migration process
* Observe the capture of transactions across every tier of technology stack, from the browser all the way down to the code and database level and how this aids analysis
* See meaningless alerts disappear, replaced with actionable alerts that include contextual data for faster MTTR

## Who should attend?

* Application teams 
* Architects 
* Developers
* Technical leads
* Operations engineers
* Infrastructure teams 

## Workshop Structure

The workshop is broken into the following sections with an approximate time we expect a section to take.  Overall you should plan for 2 to 2.5 hours to complete.

* **Prerequisites** ***(5-10 minutes)*** - Ensure your Dynatrace and AWS account is setup 
* **Workshop setup** ***(15-25 minutes)*** - Run scripts that will provision AWS resources, deploy sample application, and configure Dynatrace 
* **Dynatrace** ***(5 minutes)*** - Review how Dynatrace supports Migration and Modernization
* **Workshop exercises** ***(90 minutes)*** - Divided into three modules that map to the Migration phases (Mobilize, Migrate, Modernize, Operate)
* **Cleanup AWS and Dynatrace resources** ***(5 minutes)*** - Tear down workshop resources and resources to keep using your trial

## To make the most of the session, you should:

* Be able to run [basic Unix commands](http://mally.stanford.edu/~sr/computing/basic-unix.html)
* Be familiar with [AWS and basic cloud concepts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-overview/introduction.html)
