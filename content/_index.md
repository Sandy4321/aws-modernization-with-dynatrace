<h2>AWS Modernization and advanced observability with Dynatrace</h2>

![image](/images/dt.png)

Join Dynatrace and AWS at this hands-on workshop and we’ll help you define a migration strategy for a low-risk, smooth transition to the cloud.  You’ll use advanced observability as a tool to give you actionable insights every step of the way – from assessing, planning, migrating, and finally – optimization!

You’ll begin the workshop looking through the lens of an engineer at a mythical company called "Mythical Mysfits".  As a new member of the team, you’ll jump in for hands-on tasks on provisioning AWS resources, installing Dynatrace software intelligence for monitoring AWS, and building and learning key full-stack metrics to help guide you through the rest of the course.

## What will you learn?

* How to use technology to automatically discovery end-to-end applications, including services, processes, and hosts – a complete dependency map for the entire environment.
* How you can open full end-user, application and infrastructure visibility for BOTH your classic, on-premises systems AND your modern cloud environments with one single solution.
* How you can significantly reduce troubleshooting by using AI and automation to detect problems, pinpoint root cause, and get the business impact.  All with zero configuration to the process.
* How to detect if customers are impacted or disrupted by the migration process because you’ll analyze data across the capture of transactions across all tiers of the tech stack – from the browser, to the code and database level.
* Enjoyment as you see meaningless alerts disappear – and have them replaced with actionable alerts that include contextual data for super-fast MTTR.

## Who should attend?

* Application teams 
* Architects 
* Developers
* Technical leads
* Operations engineers
* Infrastructure teams 

## Workshop Structure

The workshop is broken into the following sections and you should plan on 2.5 hours for completion of the course.

* **Prerequisites** ***(10 minutes)*** - Ensure your Dynatrace and AWS accounts are set-up
* **Workshop setup** ***(20 minutes)*** - Run scripts that will provision AWS resources, deploy sample application, and configure Dynatrace 
* **Dynatrace in a nut-shell** ***(10 minutes)*** - Review how Dynatrace supports migration and modernization
* **Workshop exercises** ***(90 minutes)*** - Divided into three modules mapped to migration phases: mobilize, migrate, modernize, operate
* **Cleanup Resources** ***(5 minutes)*** - Tear down workshop resources and keep on using the Free Trial!  

## To make the most of the session, you should:

* Be able to run [basic Unix commands](http://mally.stanford.edu/~sr/computing/basic-unix.html)
* Be familiar with [AWS and basic cloud concepts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-overview/introduction.html)
