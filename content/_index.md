The workshop will start you from the eyes of an engineer at “Mythical Mysfits” and a list of issues the team is facing. As a new member of the team, you’ll be hands-on tasked with provisioning AWS resources, installing Dynatrace monitoring for AWS, and building and understanding some full-stack metrics to help you guide the course.

You’ll learn how to:

* Easily deploy and automatically discover applications, services, processes, hosts and build a complete dependency map for the entire application environment
* Open up full end-user, application and infrastructure visibility for BOTH your classic, on-premises systems AND your modern cloud environments with a single solution
* Understand the swift process for significantly reduce troubleshooting by using AI to automatically detect problems and pinpoint the root cause and *BONUS:* reveal business impact (with zero configuration processes)
* Detect if customers are impacted or disrupted by the migration process
* Observe the capture of transactions across every tier of technology stack, from the browser all the way down to the code and database level and how this aids analysis
* See meaningless alerts disappear, replaced with actionable alerts that include contextual data for faster MTTR
