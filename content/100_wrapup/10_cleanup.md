In order to prevent charges to your subscription we recommend cleaning up the infrastructure that was created. If you plan to keep things running so you can examine the workshop a bit more please remember to do the cleanup when you are done. It is very easy to leave things running in an AWS subscription, forget about it, and then accrue charges.
